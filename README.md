java cAssignment Guidelines: Task 4 – Reflection on Using Generative AI in Social Media Marketing Overview: The aim of this task is to explore the practical applications and implications of using Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in social media marketing for the chosen company. You will create social media content using both ChatGPT and your own creativity. You are required to focus on only one of the following options to complete the task: · Option 1: Social Media Post
· Option 2: Managerial Response to an Online Negative ReviewOption 1: Social Media Post 
Objective: To compare different approaches to creating a social media post for a chosen company, focusing on the same marketing communication objective.
Step 1: 
Find and document an actual social media post from the chosen company’s platform. Then, using the “Social Media Platform. Messaging Typology” (see Appendix 1 below), identify the primary marketing communication objective of the company’s post (e.g., product awareness, customer engagement).
Step 2: 
Independently draft a social media post for the same company, ensuring your post aligns with the marketing communication objective identified in Step 1 (e.g., if the company’s post was aimed at product awareness, your post should also focus on product awareness).
Step 3: 
Use ChatGPT to generate a social media post. Your prompt should guide ChatGPT to generate content that aligns with the marketing communication objective identified in Step 1. Be specific in your instructions to ensure relevance (refer to Lecture 8 slides, pp. 16-19).
Step 4: Compare the social media posts: the company's, your personal, and the ChatGPT-generated posts.
Deliverables for Option 1:·   A documented example of a company’s social media post (from Step 1).·   Your personally created social media post (from Step 2).·   The AI-generated social media post using ChatGPT (from Step 3).·   Use the following template table to compare the social media posts from the three different sources. Analyse each post based on the aspects listed and note your observations. This comparison will provide insights into the effectiveness of different content creation methods.

Objective: To compare different methods of crafting managerial responses to online negative reviews for a chosen company, focusing on maintaining consistency in customer service and reputation management.
Step 1:

Step 2: 
Draft your own response. Create a managerial response to the negative review identified in Step 1. Your response does not need to align with the cues identified in Step 1.
Step 3: 
Generate a response using DeepManager. Use DeepManager to create a managerial response to the negative review identified in Step 1.
